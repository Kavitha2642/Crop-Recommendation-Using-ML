# Crop-Recommendation-Using-ML
A machine learning-based crop recommendation system that predicts the best crops to grow based on environmental factors like temperature, humidity, soil nutrients, and rainfall. The system uses a trained Random Forest model to provide tailored recommendations, helping farmers make data-driven decisions for optimal crop selection.
